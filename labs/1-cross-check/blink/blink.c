/*
 * write code to allow blinking using arbitrary pins.    
 * Implement:
 *	- gpio_set_output(pin) --- set GPIO <pin> as an output (vs input) pin.
 *	- gpio_set_on(pin) --- set the GPIO <pin> on.
 * 	- gpio_set_off(pin) --- set the GPIO <pin> off.
 * Use the minimal number of loads and stores to GPIO memory.  
 *
 * start.s defines a of helper functions (feel free to look at the assembly!  it's
 *  not tricky):
 *      uint32_t get32(volatile uint32_t *addr) 
 *              --- return the 32-bit value held at <addr>.
 *
 *      void put32(volatile uint32_t *addr, uint32_t v) 
 *              -- write the 32-bit quantity <v> to <addr>
 * 
 * Check-off:
 *  1. get a single LED to blink.
 *  2. attach an LED to pin 19 and another to pin 20 and blink in opposite order (i.e.,
 *     one should be on, while the other is off).   Note, if they behave weirdly, look
 *     carefully at the wording for GPIO set.
